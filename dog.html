    <p>The domestic dog is a wolf-like canid in the genus Canis, and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore.</p>
 
  <p>Dogs are the most loyal, life saving, friendly, cuddly and caring animals in the world I recommend one if you suffer from epilepsy because they can sniff out a seizure 8-12 hours BEFORE it even happens!
And I would also recommend one if you are lonely or just want entertainment I have to Japanese Spitz dogs myself and I will be amused till the day I die but seriously I recommend one in any occasion or any breed.</p>

<p>No animal has aided humans in their endeavors more than canines (horses come closest)... And the best part of that story is the benefits have come full circle to help both sides. Only ignorant people debate whether cats are as good as dogs to humans. Those who know, shut the debate down... Dogs will, and do, put their lives on he lines to protect their human companions. Search and rescue, bomb detection, hunting, etc... What would be considered a miracle when accomplished by a cat, is considered a daily job for hundreds of thousands of dogs. Cats are known to devour their deceased owners, dogs are known to die of starvation alongside a deceased owner rather than opting to eat him/her... Say what you want about intelligence but you can't argue the loyalty and dedication. Dogs are even known to become depressed and pass away due to the broken heart phenomenon similar to an old couple. Dogs get criticized for being loud... It's a shame because back when we needed a manual warning system ...more</p>
