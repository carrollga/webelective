    <p>Rabbits are small mammals in the family Leporidae of the order Lagomorpha, found in several parts of the world.</p>
    
    <p>Yes rabbits are very cute and cuddly they are easy to take care of but if you have allergies to fur or something like that I recommend getting a bird or turtle or maybe a lizard.
They need food water a litter box if it indoor rabbit, If you want a outdoor rabbit you only have to clean its cage every two or three weeks, my rabbit like the water bottles that you hook on the cage because she likes to flip the bowls over.</p>
<p>Make sure to give your rabbit lots of attention.
Trust me I know a lot about all animals because I'm in the 4-town fair and I work at pet smart make sure to visit all our animals.</p>
<p>No cats are not good companions. Cats are stupid.</p>
<p>My aunt had a friend that had a cat and one day her friend came over with her cat and tore the ladies face apart so if you get a cat get a kitten and get rid of it before it turns six.
Thanks, be careful with what animal you choose.</p>
