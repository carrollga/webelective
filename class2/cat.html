    <p>The "House Cat", also known as the Domestic Cat or the Feral Cat, is a small feline, a good hunter, and comes in a variety of colors and fur patterns. Contrary to popular belief, however, they are not truly domesticated. They are highly intelligent and good at problem solving.</p>
    
    <p>I hate dogs. I'm scared of them. So is my brother. Once a dog almost killed my parents. Same dog almost killed my best friend. My brother doesn't like animals in general, not that there's something about them that he dosen't like, just that he's scared of getting hurt because of them. My cat was from a hoarding home of 10+ cats and 4+ dogs that would terrorize her. When she was just a kitten, her mom stopped feeding her before she was old enough to hunt on her own because my cat was the runt. She hunted for her own food, and came across our home while being lost once. She is our loving cat now, and she is sleep-purring right next to me. I would give my life for hers.</p>
